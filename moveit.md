# Introduction
Since I am going to use RRT* in MoveIt to search for motion plans, I am writing this file for illustration of files generated by MoveIt setup assistant.

# NOTE
I think I am going to use C++ in moveit motion planning since many of its tutorials are coded in C++. Tutorials in Python are really rare.

# Files
## planning_context.launch
1. load `.urdf.xacro` file to `robot_description`
2. load `.srdf.xacro` file to `robot_description_semantic`
3. load `joint_limits.yaml`. It is for specify the position, velocity, acceleration properties of joints in URDF. See [here](http://docs.ros.org/melodic/api/moveit_tutorials/html/doc/time_parameterization/time_parameterization_tutorial.html#from-file) for use of limits in MoveIt.
4. load `kinematics.yaml` for inverse kinematics solver plugin. If you have question about why MoveIt needs an inverse kinematics solver, please look at [this post](https://answers.ros.org/question/295756/in-what-space-does-moveit-plan-paths/)
   1. Explanation of its parameters can be found [here](http://docs.ros.org/melodic/api/moveit_tutorials/html/doc/kinematics_configuration/kinematics_configuration_tutorial.html)

## demo.launch
1. launch `planning_context.launch`
2. In `joint_state_publisher`, there is a line
   ```xml
   <rosparam param="/source_list">[/move_group/fake_controller_joint_states]</rosparam>
   ```
   the `source_list` parameter is the source where `joint_state_publisher` can get its source of information. Here, the `joint_state_publisher` gets information from `/move_group/fake_controller_joint_states` and publishes it on `joint_states`. Thus, information on `/move_group/fake_controller_joint_states` is the same as that on `joint_states`.
3. launch `move_group.launch`

## move_group.launch
1. launch `planning_pipeline.launch.xml`
2. launch `trajectory_execution.launch.xml`
3. launch `sensor_manager.launch.xml`
4. start node `move_group` in package `moveit_ros_move_group`

## planning_pipeline.launch.xml
1. launch `ompl_planning_pipeline.launch.xml`

## ompl_planning_pipeline.launch.xml
1. have many `arg`s 
2. load an `ompl_planning.yaml` file

## trajectory_execution.launch.xml
1. have many `arg`s
2. launch `panda_moveit_controller_manager.launch.xml`

## panda_moveit_controller_manager.launch.xml
1. have many `arg`s
2. load `panda_controllers.yaml`
